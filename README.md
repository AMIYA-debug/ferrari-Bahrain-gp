# 🏎️ **Ferrari Tyre Predictor**

### *Because someone has to save Charles from the pit wall…*

Welcome to the **Ferrari Tyre Predictor**, the highly-scientific, definitely-not-panicked attempt to prevent Scuderia Ferrari from turning tyre strategy into an experimental art form.

This project uses **machine learning** and a deep sense of emotional damage to predict whether Ferrari should put **SOFT** or **HARD** tyres on the car - specifically for the Bahrain GP (because that’s where the trauma begins).

## 🎯 **What Does This Do?**

You enter lap data like:

* Lap time
* Sector times
* Speed
* Stint
* Tyre life
* Whether the pit wall sneezed loudly that lap
* …and probably too many things

Then the model confidently tells you:

👉 **SOFT**
or
👉 **HARD**

(Which is already more decisive than Ferrari on a Sunday.)

## 😂 **Why Does This Exist?**

Because every race weekend, somewhere inside a Ferrari garage:

> “Charles, we are checking.”
> **Thirty seconds later**
> “We checked nothing, but box now.”

And the world collectively sighs.

This app ensures that next time Ferrari is confused between tyres, a computer (that at least passed maths in school) makes the decision instead.

## 🚀 **How to Run It**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

And enjoy every moment the app is smarter than Ferrari’s pit wall.



This is cleaner than Ferrari’s race strategy documents (probably because they don’t have any).

## 🧪 **Model Training**

Your model was trained on real session data to understand tyre behaviour.

Ferrari strategy was trained on:

* A coin flip
* Vibes
* And sometimes, astrology

## 📢 **Disclaimer**

This project is for fun.
Any resemblance to real Ferrari race decisions is… absolutely intentional.
